# SMS-Spam-Detector-Web-Application
Here I have build an SMS spam detection web application. This application is built in Python using the Flask framework, and contains a deep learning model that I've trained to detect SMS spam using Twilio SMS API, so that youâ€™ll be able to classify SMS messages sent to the phone number you have registered on your Twilio account
